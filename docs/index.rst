Plugin_Template Documentation
=============================

These documents divided into two type:

1. Plugin Template Documentation explains how to use the template, how to expand a bootstrapped
   plugin into a fully functional plugin. These docs also discuss moving forward with complete
   plugins, includng how to release, generate a CLI/bindings, and presents standard options for
   issue trackng, host docs, etc. All of these documents will be in the plugin-writer directory.

2. Plugin Documentation framework is a set of docs that are intended to be included (with renaming)
   in the bootstrapping of plugins. These docs create a skeleton for plugins, making documenting a
   plugin simpler and encouraging documentation patterns between plugins (so users can switch
   between them easily). This section will include installation, workflows, and anything that most
   plugins should include. All documents outside of the plugin-writer directory are templated
   docuements for each plugin.
